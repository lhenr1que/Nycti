# Window Management

Window Management owns CLEA's window-management policy boundary, including the
interfaces and backend boundary for interaction with Hyprland. Presentation
components do not implement this policy directly.

This component is responsible for preserving window-state invariants, including
keeping fullscreen applications fullscreen during ordinary desktop mode
changes, and for allowing the compositor integration to be replaced without
coupling clients to it.
